			<h2 id="Title">Basics</h2>
			<p> First things first, I am not a financial advisor. This is my best understanding of how the NHS pension applies to me and if your situation is similar to mine then maybe the information you find below will be helpful. I’m a junior doctor working in England, I’m a CT3 ACCS-AM trainee and I’m part of the 2015 NHS pension scheme.

		<h2>About the pension</h2>
		<p>The 2015 NHS Pension scheme (which is not mandatory but for most is the best pension deal) is a career average revalued earnings (CARE) defined benefits (DB) pension. You as the employee pay a percentage of your basic pre-tax salary towards these defined benefits which will be awarded to you when you reach the retirement age. When you reach retirement age you will be able to draw your yearly defined benefit.</p>
		<p>The percentages you pay are a percentage of your income<label for="sn-pension-percent" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-pension-percent" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.nhsemployers.org/your-workforce/pay-and-reward/pensions/pension-contribution-tax-relief">As explained here</a></span> - most doctors start paying 9.3% during foundation training before moving to 12.5% around the end of core training. This steps again upon becoming a consultant to 13.5% and can go as high as 14.5% once on-call commitments, clinical excellence awards or additional PAs are taken into account.<p>
		<p>The money you receive when you retire are equal to 1/54th of your pensionable earnings<label for="sn-pensionable-earnings" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-pensionable-earnings" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Your pre-tax basic income. Excluding additional pay from out of hours work.</span> for each year you have been in the scheme, this is known as the build up rate. For example an FY1 earns £26,614 basic pay, so their pension pot would rise by £492.85. A few years later the same doctor is now a ST3 and their basic pay is £46,208, this year their pension pot rises by 1/54th again - £855.70.<p>Money in your pension pot increases each year with what is called annual revaluation - this is calculated as determined by the Treasury Orders plus 1.5%, so if the Treasury Order is 2%, then 3.5% of your pot would get added as part of the annual revaluation. This is to account for inflation so that the purchasing power of your pension pot remains the same.

		<h2>Drawing your pension</h2>
		<p>Under the 2015 NHS Pension scheme the age at which you can claim your pension is the same as your State Pension age or age 65 - whichever is later. For everyone born after 6th April 1978, the current state pension age is 68 - if the state pension age increases then so will the age at which the 2015 NHS Pension can be drawn. <p>By my rough spreadsheet<label for="sn-rough-sheet" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-rough-sheet" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14TR_03z5JezM-uOYVAEhGp7XEDAR33qvWWExEa4OhfE/edit?usp=sharing">See here</a></span> I’ve got £2,360 in my pension pot so far. I could stop working for the NHS tomorrow and on my 68th birthday I could expect to get £2,360 a year (plus any increases from annual revaluation) until I die. If you die before you claim your pension, a proportion of the pot gets paid to your dependents (such as your spouse and children).<p>When you reach retirement age you can either agree to your defined benefits payout or take a lump sum or a mixture of both. You will receive those defined benefits until you die which would make budgeting easy. Taking a lump sum puts the responsibility on you to ensure the pot lasts.<p>This year I’ve been diagnosed with epilepsy and witnessed the birth of my first child. Next year I turn 30 and my knees creak already. I do not want to be working until I’m 68. Thankfully the 2015 NHS Pension scheme offer us options in the form of early retirement. The earliest possible age to claim your pension under the 2015 scheme is 55 or 12 years prior to your normal pension age (NPA - the age at which your state pension would be paid). For me, the earliest I could possibly retire is 56 (68 minus 12). However, if you decide to voluntarily take early retirement you will receive reduced benefits.<figure><img src="NPA-reduction.png" alt="Table showing percentage reduction in pension for each year pension is taken early"><label for="mn-NPA-reduction" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-NPA-reduction" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><A HREF="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/sites/default/files/2018-02/Early%20Retirement%20factsheet-20180201-
%28V4%29.pdf">Reproduced from the NHS Pension early retirement factsheet.</a></span></figure><p>They pay out less because they know that on average, they’ll have to be paying you for longer. 

		<p>If you want to retire early it is possible to pay extra to buy out the reduction which would normally be applied if you claim your NHS Pension early. It is currently possible to buy an early retirement reduction buy out (ERRBO) agreement<label for="sn-ERRBO" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-ERRBO" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><A HREF="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/sites/default/files/2018-03/ERRBO%20factsheet-20180302-%28V7%29.pdf">ERRBO factsheet</a></span> for up to three years - meaning that I could retire at 65 with no reduction, or I could retire at 56 and receive 63.3% of my pension instead of 55.4%. ERRBO doesn’t come for free, you pay for it with additional pension contributions in the form of a percentage of your pay. The percentage is based on the number of years ERRBO you wish to purchase and the age at which you are starting the ERRBO agreement. For me I would currently pay an additional 3.72% of my basic pre-tax salary for the rest of my career to purchase a 3 year ERRBO agreement.

		<h2>Getting more pension</h2>
		<p>It’s possible to increase your pension pot by purchasing additional pension - this is exactly what it sounds like you spend money now to receive additional pension during retirement. You can purchase up to an additional £6,565 annual pension - you can pay in a lump sum or in monthly instalments from your pay cheque. The cost of your additional pension can be calculated using the NHS Pension calculator, there appear to be more variables than I can concisely comment on, <a href="http://www.nhspensions.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/PensionCalculators/AdditionalPension/index.aspx">have a play for yourself.</a>Additional pension purchase offers the ability to pay in installments, for me buying the maximum over the longest time puts my monthly payments at around £320.<p>There appears to be some interaction between ERRBO and additional pension purchase which I don’t fully understand - it appears to be a one or the other style thing. But the website and factsheet aren’t very clear.

		<h2>Tax on your pension</h2>
		<p>You may have noticed recently that consultants are facing tax bills related to their pensions. This is due to a change in the way pensions are taxed. The lifetime pension allowance has recently been lowered and is currently £1.03 million - it is reported that this will increase with inflation from now on.<p>For defined benefits pension pots (such as the 2015 NHS Pension scheme) what counts towards your lifetime allowance is usually calculated as 20 times the pension received in the first year plus any lump sum taken. With my current plan of trying to retire as early as possible and with doing a max ERRBO agreement I would be looking at an annual pension of £29,440 from the age of 56 - by my rough maths<label for="sn-rough-sheet" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-rough-sheet" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14TR_03z5JezM-uOYVAEhGp7XEDAR33qvWWExEa4OhfE/edit?usp=sharing">See here</a></span> I would never reach the lifetime pension allowance. But as I said at the start, I am no financial advisor and I could be misunderstanding all of this.<p>The first £40,000 paid towards your pension each year is tax free<label for="sn-tax-free" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-tax-free" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Because it is paid from your earnings before you pay tax. At maximum NHS pension contributions you would have to be earning more than £250,000 to break the annual allowance.</span> this is your annual pension allowance. Any payment into your pension after this point will incur a tax charge.

		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>The 2015 NHS Pension is the best deal most trainees will get. We are automatically enrolled into it and if you follow standard career progression the pot will allow for a comfortable retirement. Where I personally find it gets tricky is the tight relationship with the state pension age and the benefit reductions for early retirement. <p>For junior doctors, I feel additional pension purchase [which is a flat fee] is more cost effective than ERRBO [which is a percentage fee]. I think what I am most likely to do is max out my additional pension purchase with a 20 year installment plan and retire at 58 - by my rough maths this will give me a pension of £33,190 which should be plenty as long as I've paid off my mortgage by then.<p>This entry was initially posted on the Instant Internal Medicine Patreon, if you have found this entry useful, please consider supporting on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=7765525">Patreon</a>.
