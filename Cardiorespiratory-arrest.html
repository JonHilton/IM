		<h1 id=“Test”>Cardiorespiratory arrest</h1>

		<section>
			<h2 id="Title">Basics</h2>
			<p>Cardiorespiratory arrest is when a patient is unresponsive, is not breathing and does not have a palpable pulse.
			<p> When managing cardiorespiratory arrest there are different treatment priorities in different settings. This entry focuses on in-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest of adult patients in the absence of physical trauma. This entry broadly follows the adult advanced life support (ALS) guidelines as published by the Resuscitation Council UK<label for="sn-ALS-protocol" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-ALS-protocol" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.resus.org.uk/resuscitation-guidelines/adult-advanced-life-support/#algorithm">As seen here</a></span>building on techniques learned from basic life support (BLS). Where I make personal recommendations based on my practice, I have made these clear.
			<p> A cardiorespiratory arrest can not be managed by one individual, it requires a team. Upon discovering a patient who is unresponsive and not breathing the first action should be to call the resuscitation team. Never attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) alone unless absolutely necessary, in hospital you should never be alone. Call for help immediately, become familiar with your local emergency alarms/crash buzzers and utilise them. Following a National Patient Safety Agency alert in 2004  contacting resuscitation team been done using the extension 2222 in NHS hospitals<label for="sn-double-two-double-two" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-double-two-double-two" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.resus.org.uk/archive/archived-cpr-information/standardisation-of-the-crash-call-number-2222/">As seen here</a></span>. During a cardiorespiratory arrest many actions are required to happen simultaneously - leadership of the team is vital to ensure all necessary actions are completed correctly. Leadership of a cardiorespiratory arrest of an adult in-patient will likely fall to the most senior medical trainee present<label for="sn-leader" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-leader" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> If you arrive at a cardiorespiratory arrest and ask “who is leading this?” and no one replies - you are now the leader.</span>. If at all possible at the start of your shift, meet the other members of the crash team, know their names, make sure there’s no one off sick, if possible pre-allocate roles [e.g vascular access, blood gas, chest compression].

		<h2>Who is CPR for?</h2>
		<div class="epigraph">
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					“Not all dying patients should have cardiopulmonary resuscitation attempted. Some evaluation should be made before proceeding. The cardiac arrest should be sudden and unexpected. The patient should not be in the terminal stages of a malignant or other chronic disease, and there should be some possibility of a return to functional existence.”
				<footer>“Report of application of external cardiac massage on 118 patients” Jude et al JAMA vol 178, No 11, page 1063 - Published December 16th 1961</footer>
			<blockquote>
		</div>
			<p>It is important to remember that CPR should not be performed in every dying patient. In patients where there is no reasonable possibility of a return to functional existence CPR should not be performed. In patients who you feel have a high risk of dying during this admission or within the next 12 months you should have the resuscitation conversation<label for="sn-resuscitation-conversation" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-resuscitation-conversation" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.dyingmatters.org/gp_page/resuscitation-conversation">See here</a></span> to allow that person to have a natural death. As with all of medicine, before you undertake an intervention ask yourself "Are my intentions honourable?"<label for="sn-intentions" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-intentions" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Shamelessly stolen from the <a href="https://youtu.be/GFX_tocJShA">late great Dr John Hinds</a></span>.
		<h2>Good quality CPR</h2>
			<p>Thirty chest compressions are delivered at a rate of roughly 100 compressions per minute, followed by two breaths delivered using a self inflating bag valve mask. When done correctly chest compressions will tire staff quickly - if leading a cardiorespiratory arrest, ensure you regularly check with staff performing compressions if they are fatigued. Ask two or three people from the team to rotate amongst themselves to ensure good quality compressions can reliably be delivered.
		<h2>Oxygenation and airways</h2>	
			<figure><img src="BVM.png" alt="Image of bag valve mask"><label for="mn-BVM" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-BVM" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">The BVM should be connected to an oxygen supply delivering 15 litres oxygen per minute. It is important to remember that holding the mask over the patient’s mouth does not deliver oxygen continuously due to the valves - it is only when the bag is squeezed is oxygen delivered. <a href="https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ambu_Bag_valve_mask.jpg">BVM image reproduced from Wikimedia.</a></span></figure>
			<p>Most bag valve masks (BVMs) have a large reservoir bag which can deliver as much as 2 litres of oxygen when squeezed, a normal adult breath is around 500 mL (7mls per kg) so even accounting for a poor seal around the patient’s mouth only squeezing half the bag should be sufficient for delivering rescue breaths.
			<p>Simple manoeuvres can help - head tilt, chin lift or a jaw thrust may make oxygenation better.
			<figure><img src="head-tilt.png" alt="Image of head tilt, chin lift"><label for="mn-head-tilt" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-head-tilt" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">Head tilt, chin lift can stop the tongue obstructing the airway. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Tongue_blocking_airway.svg/800px-Tongue_blocking_airway.svg.png">Image from Wikimedia</a></span></figure>
			<p>An airway adjunct such as an oropharyngeal airway (the red plastic seen in the picture and often simply called a Guedel after the inventor) or a nasopharyngeal airway (often shortened to NP airway or NPA) can also be helpful.<figure><img src="jaw-thrust.jpg" alt="Image of jaw thrust"><label for="mn-jaw-thrust" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-jaw-thrust" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">A jaw thrust can assist oxygenation. An oropharyngeal airway can be seen in place. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Jaw_thrust_maneuver.jpg">Image from Wikimedia</a> If your hands don’t ache shortly after initiating a jaw thrust, you’re probably not doing it right.</span></figure>
			<p>More advanced airway interventions include supraglotic airways and endotracheal tubes. Supraglotic airways (SGAs) come in a variety of options<label for="sn-SGAs" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-SGAs" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I’m sure the toes of my anaesthetic colleagues will curl as I explain these.</span> but broadly speaking they are plastic tubes with either an inflatable cuff or a special plastic cuff which mould to glottis. SGAs are a halfway house between BVM and endotracheal intubation - SGAs are not a definitive airway but they are relatively straightforward to put in and are probably better than BVM ventilation.<figure><img src="i-gel.jpg" alt="Image of an i-Gel supraglotic airway"><label for="mn-i-gel" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-i-gel" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">An i-Gel, the green coloured part is designed to mould to the patient. <a href="i-gel.jpg">Image from Wikimedia</a></span></figure>
			<p>It is relatively straightforward to site a SGA without interrupting good quality CPR and it will often provide better oxygenation than BVM ventilation.
			<p>Placing an endotracheal tube (ETT) is very different - it is a technical skill which requires considerable training and manual dexterity, it can be tricky at the best of times, let alone during a cardiorespiratory arrest.<figure><img src="endotracheal-tube.png" alt="Image of endotracheal tube and relevant anatomy"><label for="mn-ETT" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-ETT" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Endotracheal_Tube.png">Endotracheal tube image reproduced from Wikimedia.</a></span></figure> 
			<p>Intubation should only be attempted by someone who has appropriate airway competencies<label for="sn-airways" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-airways" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">If you are an ACCS trainee you will gain these as part of your anaesthetics/ICM attachment, if you are an IMT trainee you may not.</span>. CPR will likely have to be interrupted or intubation will have to wait until the cycle is completed and a pulse check performed. An ETT which is seen to pass through the vocal cords, has the cuff inflated and from which you can record an expiratory carbon dioxide waveform is a definitive airway - blood, vomit or other debris from the upper airway should no longer affect oxygenation.

		<h2>Shockable vs Non-shockable:</h2>
		<p>With minimal interruptions to chest compressions and rescue breaths a defibrillator/monitor should be attached to the patient to allow for assessment of the underlying cardiac rhythm. Different hospitals have different equipment, become familiar with what is used locally. Upon attachment of the defibrillator compressions should momentarily pause to allow for rhythm assessment, compressions should be re-started immediately. Once the underlying cardiac rhythm has been identified the ongoing treatment branches into shockable rhythms and non-shockable rhythms.
		<p>Shockable rhythms are ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT).
		<figure><img src="VF.png" alt="ECG image of ventricular fibrillation"><label for="mn-VF" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-VF" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:De-Rhythm_ventricular_fibrillation_(CardioNetworks_ECGpedia).png">VF ECG image reproduced from Wikimedia.</a></span></figure> 
		<figure><img src="VT.jpg" alt="ECG image of ventricular tachycardia"><label for="mn-VT" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-VT" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:12_lead_generated_ventricular_tachycardia.JPG">VT ECG image reproduced from Wikimedia.</a></span></figure> 
		<p>Shockable rhythms are treated with good quality CPR, adrenaline, amiodarone and electricity<label for="sn-joules" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-joules" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">An energy setting of at least 150J for the first shock, the same or higher if further shocks are required.</span>. The leader of the resuscitation team should loudly announce that a shock will be delivered and everyone apart from the team member delivering chest compressions should step away. While the defibrillator is charging chest compressions should continue and oxygen supplied. Prior to a shock being delivered the team leader should announce with unambiguous language that a shock is going to be delivered and give instructions for the team - “defibrillator charged, oxygen away, stand clear, shocking now, back on the chest”<label for="sn-explosive" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-explosive" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Oxygen is explosive, electrical shocks can ignite oxygen supplies so the oxygen must be removed prior to shock being delivered</span>.
		<p>During a further two minute cycle of CPR the team leader should prepare the team for a pause - during this pause a central pulse should be checked and the cardiac rhythm re-assessed. If the patient remains in VF or pVT then deliver a second shock and a further cycle of CPR. If at the next VF or pVT remains the underlying rhythm administer a third shock and intravenous adrenaline 1mg and intravenous amiodarone 300mg. If cycles of CPR are ongoing, further 1mg doses of adrenaline should be given at roughly 3-5 minute intervals - this lines up with every other shock.
		<p>Non-shockable rhythms are pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and asystole. PEA is any electrical activity which does not provide sufficient cardiac output to give a palpable pulse. Asystole is the absence of any electrical activity.		
		<figure><img src="asystole.jpg" alt="ECG image of asystole"><label for="mn-VT" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-VT" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Asystole11.JPG">ECG image reproduced from Wikimedia showing two normal beats and then asystole.</a></span></figure>
		<p>Non-shockable rhythms are treated with good quality CPR and adrenaline. 1mg of adrenaline should be administered as soon as access is obtained. After every two minute cycle a pulse and rhythm check should be performed - if the patient transitions to VF or pVT then treatment transitions to the shockable side of the algorithm. When asystole is diagnosed, be sure to check the ECG carefully - if P waves are present then the patient may respond to cardiac pacing. However, there is no benefit to be gained from pacing true asystole.

		<h2>Access and blood tests:</h2>
		<p>Once good quality CPR has been initiated and an initial rhythm check performed, one of the next important tasks is gaining a route for drug delivery. In an ideal situation this would be intravenous access<label for="sn-one-is-none" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-one-is-none" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In my practice I follow the “one is none” rule, if we have one cannula, get a second.</span>. If intravenous access is proving tricky, intraosseous (IO) access should be gained. With increased availability of kits and ease of insertion the IO route is becoming more common during cardiorespiratory arrests. Any medications you would want to give IV can be given IO<label for="sn-IO-tests" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-IO-tests" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">As long as you warn your friendly lab technicians you are sending a bone marrow sample you can aspirate from the IO and send it to the lab for testing.</span>.
		<p>When administering medications during cardiorespiratory arrest, ensure at least 20mls 0.9% sodium chloride are given afterwards to ensure the medication reaches the central circulation. If a patient already has central venous access then this could be used, but do not interrupt CPR to site a central line. 
		<p>A blood gas - be it venous or arterial is going to provide useful information during a cardiorespiratory arrest. It will be difficult to reliably palpate the radial artery and often a femoral stab is required. Capillary testing should not routinely be relied upon as the values can not be trusted in the context of cardiorespiratory arrest. 
		</section>

		<h2>Treating the treatable - 4Hs + 4Ts</h2>
		<p>Some reversible causes of cardiorespiratory arrest have specific treatments which can be administered during CPR. To make remembering them easier they are often broken down into the 4 Hs and 4Ts.
		<p><b>Hypoxia</b> can be a cause of cardiorespiratory arrest. Good quality CPR and administering oxygen via a face mask or an advanced airway can treat hypoxia. When rescue breaths are administered, listen over the chest to ensure bilateral breath sounds are present. If there is blood, vomit or other in the mouth - careful use of suction can rectify this - never suction further than you can see. 
		<p><b>Hypovolaemia</b> can be a cause of cardiorespiratory arrest as PEA can result from severe haemorrhage or other low cardiac output states. A fluid challenge (500ml of balanced crystalloid) is rarely a bad idea during a cardiorespiratory arrest. If there is evidence of haemorrhage or you are concerned about concealed haemorrhage - replace with appropriate blood products.
		<p><b>Hyperkalaemia</b> (high potassium), <b>hypokalaemia</b> (low potassium), <b>hypocalacemia</b> (low calcium), <b>acidaemia</b> (low pH) and other metabolic disorders will be shown by the blood gas. They can also be suggested by a patient’s past medical history (renal failure can give rise to hyperkalaemia). Intravenous calcium chloride is the treatment of choice to stabilise the heart if a patient is found to have high potassium (treatment for high potassium is insulin and dextrose as this encourages transfer of the potassium from the blood stream into cells - more on this in a separate entry), low calcium or has taken a calcium channel-blocker overdose.
		<p><b>Hypothermia</b> is usually apparent based on the history of the moments preceding the cardiorespiratory arrest. It would be an unlikely cause of an adult in hospital developing cardiorespiratory arrest but should not be forgotten. Warming blankets and ensuring the patient is dry and covered will help treat a low temperature.
		<p><b>Thrombosis</b> of a coronary artery is a common cause of sudden cardiac arrest. A history of ischaemic heart disease or reports of recent chest pain may be signs that coronary artery thrombosis is a possibility. Transfer for urgent coronary angiography can occur during CPR if feasible<label for="sn-transfer-during-cpr" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-transfer-during-cpr" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See notes below about mechanical chest compression devices and extracorporal CPR</span> or will have to wait until ROSC is achieved.
		<p>A second type of <b>thrombosis</b> which can cause cardiorespiratory arrest is massive pulmonary thromboembolism (PE). If a massive PE is considered the cause of the cardiorespiratory arrest then fibrinolytics should be administered early on in the resuscitation attempt. PE is a reversible cause of cardiorespiratory arrest but the treatment takes much longer than many others - it is often recommended that CPR should be continued for at least 60 minutes after administration of fibrinolytics. There is data showing survival and good neurological outcomes even after such prolonged resuscitation attempts.
		<p><b>Tension pneumothorax</b> can cause PEA and although often associated with trauma, tension pneumothorax can also present in the absence of trauma. Diagnosis is always clinical<label for="sn-lung-USS" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-lung-USS" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Unless you’re trained in lung ultrasound.</span> - absent breath sounds during rescue breath delivery or deviated trachea should prompt you to consider tension pneumothorax. Rapid decompression with either thoracostomy or needle decompression<label for="sn-tension-treatment" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-tension-treatment" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Large cannula inserted perpendicular to the chest wall into the second intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line</span> should provide almost immediate relief. These are temporary treatments, definitive treatment would be insertion of a chest drain.  	
		<p><b>Cardiac tamponade</b> can be very difficult to diagnose during cardiorespiratory arrest - classical signs of distended neck veins and low blood pressure will not be apparent. Focused cardiac ultrasound is likely to be the only way to make the diagnosis<label for="sn-CPR-ultrasound" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-CPR-ultrasound" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Have a look at FICE and FEEL two ultrasound courses which teach the views to get during your 10 second pulse check after a CPR cycle.</span>. Absence of cardiac motion on focused ultrasound during resuscitation is highly predictive of death.
		<p>Many prescription and illicit drugs can cause <b>toxic</b> cardiorespiratory arrest. In the event of a known toxin <a href="https://www.toxbase.org/">ToxBase</a> is your go to resource - otherwise good quality CPR and standard ALS algorithm is going to be your mainstay of treatment.
		</section>		
		<section>
		<h2>Mechanical CPR:</h2>
		<p>As mentioned above, chest compressions when done correctly will quickly tire members of the team. When it can be predicted that a cardiorespiratory arrest will be prolonged<label for="sn-prolonged-CPR" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-prolonged-CPR" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Such as in the case of PE thrombolysis or to get to angiography or to get onto ECMO.</span> or where there simply are not enough team members to rotate safely then mechanical devices can be used to deliver chest compressions. From an evidence based medicine perspective, there is not enough evidence to support or refute the use of these devices. In my practice, if I were leading a cardiorespiratory arrest which was going to be prolonged, I would ask for such a device to be used. Getting the device into position can be tricky, it can interrupt compressions for longer than you realise, make sure you are familiar with the device used in your hospital. 
		<p>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) essentially replaces the function of the heart and lungs. ECMO involves siting large bore central access to siphon off blood to a cardiopulmonary bypass machine which oxygenates the blood and pushes it back into the patient. It is incredibly resource intensive both from a staff and equipment perspective - however there are studies which point towards ECMO assisted life support (ECLS) providing improved outcomes for in-hospital cardiac arrest in patients who have a cardiac origin for their witnessed cardiorespiratory arrest<label for="sn-ECLS-evidence" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-ECLS-evidence" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21057309">See here</a>.</span>. Very few hospitals in the UK will routinely be able to offer this.
		</section>
		<section>
		<h2>Where do we go now?</h2>
		<p>Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is the point at which we transition from CPR to post-resuscitation care. In most cases this will involve transfer of the patient to an area such as high dependency or intensive care. Before you leave your place of relative safety, ensure the receiving unit know you are coming, ensure you have enough staff and equipment should the patient have a further cardiorespiratory arrest. Use an ABCDE approach to assess your patient and resolve issues before continuing.
		<h2>Cardiorespiratory arrests can happen in awkward locations:</h2>
		<p>You will be called to toilet cubicles, to stairwells, to car parks and to hallways. People do not always have a cardiorespiratory arrest while lying neatly on a bed. A priority in these situations must be staff safety, do not endanger yourself or others. Once safety is assured, ensure you have all of the appropriate equipment - crash trolley and defibrillator. Getting the patient off the floor can be difficult but will make everything easier - if you can do it without interrupting good quality chest compressions, do it.
		<h2>Invite the relatives in:</h2>
		<p>If relatives of the patient are present and if it would not impact on patient or staff safety and if the relatives want to present then I feel they should be present during a resuscitation attempt. You may need to dedicate a member of your team to explain what is happening to allow the relative to process the situation. Over the last few years I have invited relatives in for resuscitation attempts and I have never regretted it. Although guidelines recommend this practice, it still remains contentious<label for="sn-relatives" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-relatives" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/critical-care/supporting-relatives-who-choose-to-witness-resuscitation-attempts/7023321.article">See here</a>.</span>.
		</section>

		<h2>Summary:</h2>
		<p><b>Leading a team is hard</b> - in a high intensity stressful situation such as cardiorespiratory arrest even more so. Do everything you can in advance to make it easier - meet each other, know each other's names, pre-allocate roles.
		<p><b>Discuss cardiopulmonary resuscitation></b> - discuss it with every patient where there is a possibility of them requiring it. Be honest about the survival rates. Explain what survival looks like.
		<p><b>Good quality chest compressions are tiring></b> - ensure chest compressions remain good quality by rotating the staff delivering them. In prolonged CPR, get a machine to do the compressions. Maximise time delivering good quality chest compressions by keeping interruptions to a minimum.
		<p><b>Give adrenaline every 3-5 minutes</b>
		<p><b>Shockable rhythms are VF and pulseless VT</b> - everything else is non-shockable.
		<p><b>If in a shockable rhythm and no response after 3 shocks, give amiodarone.</b> 
		<p><b>Give oxygen in the most efficient manner possible</b> escalating techniques where necessary - manoeuvres —> BVM —> SGA —> ETT
		<p><b>Get access and send blood tests.</b>
		<p><b>Treat the treatable causes</b> - hypoxia, hypovolaemia, hypo/hyperkalaemia, hypothermia, thrombosis, tension pneumothorax, tamponade and toxins.
		<p><b>Invite the family in.</b>
