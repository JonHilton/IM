			<h2 id="Title">What's all this then?</h2>
			<p> This site is my attempt at writing a medical textbook that I actually like. Websites are not paper textbooks and this site isn't going to look or feel like your standard textbook. If it does, I've done something wrong and you should let me know.</p>
			
			<h2>How is it going to work?</h2>
			<p>The content for this site will be based on the new JRCPTB internal medicine curriculum<label for="sn-internal-medicine-curriculum" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-internal-medicine-curriculum" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.jrcptb.org.uk/new-internal-medicine-curriculum">JRCPTB Internal Medicine Curriculum</a></span> this is stuff that I as a general medical trainee in the UK need to know and <i>*they*</i> say that the best way to learn something is to teach it. The content is going to be pitched at the level a medical trainee, hopefully others will still find it useful.</p>
			
			<h2>Wait a second, who are you?</h2>
			<p>I'm Jon Hilton, at the time of writing I am an ACCS-AM CT3<label for="sn-ACCS-AM" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-ACCS-AM" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This means that I am in the third year of core training in the <a href="https://www.imtrecruitment.org.uk/about-imt/about-accs">acute medicine branch</a> of <a href="https://www.rcoa.ac.uk/accs">acute care common stem</a>. I'm a medical doctor who works in a hospital.</span>. The content of this site is all stuff that I need to know anyway to do my job well and to pass my exams.</p>
			
			<h2>What is Patreon?</h2>
			<p>To help fund this the creation and upkeep of this project I have opened a page on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/JonHilton">Patreon</a>. Patreon is a service which allows people creating stuff to sell it. The sections of this website will always be free and open access. But Patreon supporters will get bonuses in addition to a warm fuzzy feeling inside themselves for helping me with this project.</p>
			
			<h2>What are all those little numbers?</h2>
			<p>This site uses a particular style of formatting popularised by an American statistician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte">Edward Tufte</a> and the site uses <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS</a> to achieve this style. The little numbers you see are sidenotes<label for="sn-are-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-are-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This is a sidenote</span> if your screen is not wide enough to display the sidenotes, clicking/tapping on the superscript number will display the sidenote.</p>
