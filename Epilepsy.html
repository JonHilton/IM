			<h2 id="Title">What is Epilepsy?</h2>
			<p> Epilepsy is not one disease, it is a collection of conditions<label for="sn-conditions" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-conditions" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">ILAE practical <a href="https://www.ilae.org/guidelines/definition-and-classification/definition-of-epilepsy-2014">clinical definition of epilepsy</a></span> - all of which have seizures as a component. Epileptic seizures are the result of a disturbance in the normal electrical activity of the brain. The central and peripheral nervous systems are essentially one big electrical circuit. When the electrical circuit is not operating correctly the electrical signals can have some unintended consequences. Around 1 in 100 people in the UK have a form of epilepsy, there are a variety of ways their electrical circuits will not be operating correctly. In October 2018 I was diagnosed with epilepsy following a collapse at work<label for="sn-work" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-work" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I’m still pleased with myself that I managed to send the TTO to pharmacy <i>before</i> seizing.</span>.
			<h3>Gaining an epilepsy diagnosis:</h3>
			<ol type="1">
				<li>At least two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart.</li>
				<li>One unprovoked seizure and at least 60% chance of having further seizure activity in the next 10 years.</li>
				<li>Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome.</li></ol>
			<p>Anyone, if subjected to enough physiological stress, could have a seizure. Epilepsy is a disease in which an individual has a pathological lowering of their seizure threshold. Having one unprovoked seizure or having multiple provoked seizures does not result in that individual gaining a diagnosis of epilepsy. Provoked seizures<label for="sn-provoked" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-provoked" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Examples of provoked seizures include alcohol withdrawal, post-concussion and fever related.</span> are those in which there is a temporary factor acting on an otherwise normal brain to lower the seizure threshold<label for="sn-photic" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-photic" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Seizures triggered by photic stimuli is probably the one situation where a provoked seizure results in an epilepsy diagnosis.</span>.
			<p>High recurrence risk<label for="sn-recurrence-risk" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-recurrence-risk" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Why 60% and not any other arbitrary number? Because of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16545748">MESS trial</a>.</span> can be difficult to quantify but it does allows for diagnosis of epilepsy without the need for a second seizure. This would the case where an individual has a seizure following a stroke or a structural abnormality is found on imaging.
			<h3>Losing an epilepsy diagnosis:</h3>
			<p>Epilepsy can be considered resolved if an individual has been seizure free for the last 10 years with no antiepileptics taken for the last 5 years. 
			<p>The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) published classifications<label for="sn-ILAE-classifications" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-ILAE-classifications" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.ilae.org/files/ilaeGuideline/ClassificationOfEpilepsies_Scheffer_et_al-2017-Epilepsia.pdf">See here</a>.</span> to standardise the way we talk about epilepsy. The multi-level classification system to allows it to be used across a range of healthcare settings. 
			<p><b>First level - Seizure type:</b> Most basic level this categorises seizures using their mode of onset - focal, generalised or unknown. 
			<p><b>Second level - Epilepsy type:</b> Involving investigations such as EEG and cross sectional imaging the second level of classification is dependent on the type of seizure exhibited - focal, generalised, combined generalised & focal, unknown. The combined classification is a new group added by the 2017 classification, it is for patients who have both generalised and focal seizures. The unknown group is reserved for patients where there is insufficient information to categorise - the example given is that of a patient with symmetrical tonic-clonic seizures without focal features and normal EEG. In this instance the seizure onset is unknown and the epilepsy type is unknown.
			<p><b>Third level - Epilepsy syndrome:</b> Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome will use information gathered from sources such as EEG, cross sectional imaging, history of disease and co-existing conditions.
			<p>People with epilepsy are advised to avoid situations where they may be a danger to themselves or others such as - driving or riding, bathing or swimming alone, working at height or going up ladders and being near open fire.

		<h2>Causes of Epilepsy</h2>
		<p>As mentioned above, anyone can have a seizure when pushed to the limit. In people with epilepsy that limit is lowered for some reason, we classify those reasons into the following categories - structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune, unknown or any combination.
		<p>Abnormalities of the brain structure can give rise to epilepsy. To use myself as an example, I have a venous malformation near my left inferior frontal gyrus - this is a low pressure system with weak vascular walls which on occasion have bled. <figure><img src="abnormality-on-ct.png" alt="CT of my head"><label for="mn-ct-head" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-ct-head" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">Yes, that is my head on CT. I'm no radiologist but I've marked the most striking abnormality.</span></figure><p>On the CT you can see the different ages of bleeds because of the heterogeneity of the circled section. Structural abnormalities can be acquired through scarring of brain tissue as in hypoxic brain injury, traumatic brain injury, infection and stroke.
		<p>There are now some well described genetic causes of epilepsy. A strong family history of epilepsy should prompt genetic testing<label for="sn-genetic-testing" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-genetic-testing" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In Benign familial neonatal epilepsy most families have a mutation of one of the potassium genes KCNQ2 or KCNQ3.</span>. Not all genetic causes of epilepsy will be inherited, brand new mutations are being identified in both mild and severe epilepsies. From there on, if the mutation is autosomal dominant their offspring would have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation<label for="sn-genetic-testing2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-genetic-testing2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Genetic penetration and genetic testing is a broad enough topic for its own entry so we’ll leave this here.</span>.
		<p>Often linked to a genetic defect, metabolic causes of epilepsy are those where epilepsy results directly from a known or presumed metabolic disorder. Examples include porphyria, uraemia, aminoacidopathies<label for="sn-create-a-sidenote" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-create-a-sidenote" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">An example being phenylketonuria (PKU), one of the nine conditions tested for by the newborn blood spot tests.</span> and pyridoxine-dependent seizures. Metabolic causes of epilepsy each have a specific treatment so early diagnosis is key to prevent potential intellectual impairment.
		<p>The ILAE uses the infectious classification to refer to epilepsy as a core symptom of the infection and not an individual having seizures because of an acute infection such as in meningitis or encephalitis. Examples include HIV, cerebral malaria, cerebral toxoplasmosis and also congenital infectious such as Zika virus or cytomegalovirus. In cases where an individual continues to have seizures after an acute infection has been treated<label for="sn-post-infection" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-post-infection" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">As can happen with viral encephalitis.</span> this could be classified as an infectious aetiology.
		<p>Immune mediated epilepsies are essentially autoimmune conditions which cause recurrent seizures. Diagnosis of such a condition will often be by doing an expensive antibody test on cerebrospinal fluid from a lumbar puncture. Examples include anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and anti-VGKC-complex encephalitis. Mainstay of treatment is immune system suppression with corticosteroids, chemotherapy agents [such as rituximab], intravenous immunoglobulin or targeted immunotherapies.

		<h2>What does a seizure look like?</h2>
		<p>As mentioned in the section above about how types of epilepsy are classified, seizures can broadly be split into types depending on if they are focal or general, if awareness is retained or impaired and the type of motor activity displayed - clonic, tonic or myoclonic<label for="sn-seizure-video" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-seizure-video" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Videos for all of these can be <a href="https://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/seizure-types">found here</a>.</span>.
		<p>Focal aware seizures (previously known as simple partial seizures) originate in one particular part of the brain and can give rise to unusual/strange sensations which can be hard for the individual to categorise. Focal impaired awareness seizures (previously known as complex partial seizures) often affect are larger portion of the brain than focal aware seizures, individuals experiencing this type of seizure often appear confused, may have impaired hearing or speech and there is often a post-ictal period. Both types of focal seizure can include a variety of both motor and non-motor signs and symptoms - it all depends on which area of the brain is affected. When a focal seizure progresses to a generalised seizure this is called focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure (previously known as a secondarily generalised seizure) - this can happen very quickly and the individual may not know they had a focal seizure preceding their generalised seizure. 
		<p>Generalised onset seizures occur without warning and affect both side of the brain. The individual will be unconscious, will have a post-ictal period and will likely not remember the events of the seizure. Tonic clonic seizures are what most people think of when they think of a seizure. The individual’s muscles will rhythmically contract and relax in a classical shaking pattern, they might bite their tongue, they might be incontinent of urine, their breathing may become laboured or noisy<label for="sn-seizure-pain" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-seizure-pain" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">My experience of a tonic-clonic seizure is dominated by the severe musculoskeletal pain I was in for the next couple of days with mild pain ongoing for weeks after my seizure.</span>.
		</section>
		<h2>Investigations</h2>
		<p>When an individual first presents with a seizure and is in the process of gaining an epilepsy diagnosis investigations should be focused on determining the cause of their epilepsy and excluding alternative diagnosis and referral to a specialist service<label for="sn-investigations" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-investigations" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">As described in this <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg137/chapter/1-Guidance">NICE Guidance</a></span>.
		<p>Basic blood tests such as full blood count, urea and electrolytes, blood sugar and calcium should be performed in all patients. A 12-lead ECG will allow exclusion of cardiac causes of collapse. Cross sectional imaging is important to determine if a structural abnormality is present. Practically CT head is often easier and quicker to obtain, a CT head will reveal any acute neurological lesion or illness<label for="sn-quick" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-quick" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Such as an acute bleeds or mass effect</span>. MRI head will likely take longer to arrange but will allow for greater ability to assess for more long term structural abnormalities.<figure><img src="abnormality-on-mri.png" alt="MRI of my head"><label for="mn-mri-head" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-mri-head" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">My head on MRI, again I'm no radiologist but I've marked the most striking abnormality.</span></figure>
		<p>Electroencephalogram [EEG] is a specialist investigation usually only requested by neurologists. It is not a first line investigation and should not be used in isolation to make a diagnosis of epilepsy. However, it can be useful to categorise the seizure type and epilepsy syndrome which allows for correct prognostication and long term management. 
		</section>

		<h2>Management</h2>
		<p>Management of epilepsy can be broken down into managing an acute seizure and long term management of seizure prevention.
		<h3>Acute seizure</h3>
		<p>Basic acute seizure management should focus on ensuring the individual does not injure themselves during the seizure - if they are against a radiator or other heat source move them away, if they are in a bath or swimming pool get them out. Do not put anything in their mouth. Note the time when the seizure starts and stops, if the seizure lasts more than 5 minutes this may be status epilepticus and additional help required.  
		<p>Status epilepticus<label for="sn-pulmcrit-status" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-pulmcrit-status" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Josh Farkas has covered this topic <a href="https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/status-epilepticus-2/">here</a>.</span> is the term used when there is a persistent generalised seizure or when an individual has repeated seizures without full recovery, it is a medical emergency. Swift termination of seizure activity and safety of the individual are key. As with many medical emergencies an A to E assessment approach is used. If the airway and breathing are compromised emergency intubation may be required. 
		<p>Although any benzodiazepine could be used, 4mg intravenous lorazepam is often the most commonly used - guidelines will often state that the first dose should be given after 5 minutes of seizure activity<label for="sn-5mins" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5mina" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In my personal experience, lorazepam is often kept locked in a fridge, if by the time I have found the keys to the locked fridge, gotten the lorazepam out of the locked fridge, second checked the ampule and drawn up the dose <i><b>and</i></b> the seizure activity is still ongoing, I’m going to give the lorazepam.</span> and repeated doses can be used if there is no response to the initial dose. If intravenous access is difficult, intramuscular midazolam or buccal midazolam could be used. 
		<p>Traditionally phenytoin was the first line anti-epileptic drug and many hospital protocols will still prominently list it. However, there is a growing body of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28282553">evidence to support</a> using alternatives. Phenytoin is awkward to administer - it requires a good quality cannula often in the antecubital fossa and the IV line requires a special filter. Phenytoin is administered as the prodrug fosphenytoin which requires conversion to the active drug phenytoin before it can work. Phenytoin has marked adverse side effects such as bradycardia and hypotension. Phenytoin has more drug interactions than other alternatives. If the cause of seizure is unknown phenytoin is a bad choice as it has sodium-channel blocking effects which can worsen some drug overdoses<label for="sn-tricyclics" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-tricyclics" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Tricyclic antidepressant overdose causes cardiotoxic effects as a result from blockade of inactiveated fast sodium channels.</span>.
		
		<p>So what do we use instead? The <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01960075">ESETT trial</a> is currently trying to answer that question as currently we are in a state of equipoise. Levetiracetam is gaining in popularity<label for="sn-my-status" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-my-status" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">When I came round from my tonic-clonic it’s what was running through my cannula.</span> as there are almost no contraindications, is generally well tolerated and is easy to administer.
		<p>If the status epilepticus continues in spite of benzodiazepine and in spite of anti-epileptic drug, it’s time for a rapid sequence induction and intubation. Propofol infusion provides ongoing anti-epileptic activity, if hypotension becomes an issue then a midazolam infusion can be used instead. 
		<h3>Long term management</h3>
		<p>For long term epilepsy treatment monotherapy with a single anti-epileptic drug is preferred. Picking a drug to use is going to based on seizure type or epilepsy syndrome<label for="sn-nice-prescribing" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-nice-prescribing" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See NICE guidance <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg137/chapter/appendix-e-pharmacological-treatment">here</a>. If one anti-epileptic drug is not sufficient to control seizures then a second can be added - either an alternative first-line or from the adjunctive column.</span>. Special attention should be paid to prescribing sodium valproate to anyone who is or may become pregnant - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/valproate-use-by-women-and-girls">sodium valproate is known to cause congenital malformations</a>. At medical school I was taught to always prescribe anti-epileptic drugs by the brand name, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/antiepileptic-drugs-updated-advice-on-switching-between-different-manufacturers-products">however this is not always the case</a> and for some drugs generic should be equivalent<label for="sn-generic-prescribing" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-generic-prescribing" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Prescribing a generic can provide a significant cost saving to the NHS - <a href="https://openprescribing.net/measure/keppra/">over £1 million would have been saved in last 6 months</a> prescribing generic Levetiracetam instead of Keppra.</span> - although special thought should be given to modified release preparations which often differ when produced by different companies.
		<p>In my clinical practice I am seeing Clobazam<label for="sn-clobazam" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-clobazam" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A benzodiazepine with a long duration of action and half life.</span> being used as a rescue/bridging therapy when there is a short period where seizure threshold may be lowered. I’ve seen it used when there has been an uptitration in usual anti-epileptic drug, when transitioning from one anti-epileptic drug to another and also when there is another factor lowering seizure threshold<label for="sn-span" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-clobazam" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Such as acute infection.</span>. The prescriptions I have seen have mostly been 5mg taken once a day at night - due to the sedating nature of benzodiazepines. 
		
		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>Epilepsy is a collection of conditions which have seizures as a component. The ILAE provide guidance on how to classify epilepsy and how to categorise the causes of epilepsy. Seizures are varied in nature, their clinical presentation will be dependent on where the epileptic focus is within the brain. Investigations should include blood tests, ECG, cross sectional imaging and if required an EEG. Management of status epilepticus uses escalating measures to swiftly terminate the seizure. Long term management of epilepsy is focused on using the fewest drugs with the most tolerable side effects to prevent seizures occurring.
